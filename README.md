# Testing
The site was tested in 4 browsers for Windows PC - Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera. No issues were detected. Chrome browser test passed - no issues detected. Mobile browsers tested - Chrome, Firefox, Samsung browser - no issues detected. The site is fully responsive for every size device.
My friends helped me a lot with game testing so I can assure you that the current version is free of bugs, responsive, and it's a lot of fun to play.

There were 2 issues found in JS file, but time constraints haven't allowed me to dive in to understand why was this flagged, however, it hasn't affected the code functionality in any way:

## Accessibility
Mobile version:

Desktop version:

The accessibility score for mobile devices is 97 points due to the warning for color contrast, however, I've tested the game on multiple devices and the color contrast is ok in my opinion (my testers (and friends :)) agree with me). For the desktop, it's 100. Aria labels and titles are used in this project.
